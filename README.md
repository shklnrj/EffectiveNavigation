EffectiveNavigation
===================

This is just a modification of Android's default navigation example where-
1- We use a fragment instead of main activity for the tab-enabled navigation feature.
2- Provide fragment based menu items avaliable. This means-
	(a) The main activity would have a few menu items.
	(b) Fragment would have its own menu items. These menu items would be added to the parent activity's menu, when we have this fragment added to that activty.
